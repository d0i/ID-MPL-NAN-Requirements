             Neighborhood Area Network Requirements for MPL
                 draft-doi-roll-mpl-nan-requirements-00

Abstract

   Neighborhood area networks (NAN) is expected to use MPL to distribute
   information over wireless mesh network with 6lowpan/802.15.4.  This
   document is to describe expected use case and requirements of NAN,
   based on OpenSG requirements.

Internet-Draft           NAN Requirement for MPL           November 2013


1.  Introduction

   Neighborhood area networks (NAN) is expected to use MPL to distribute
   information over wireless mesh network with 6lowpan/802.15.4.  This
   document is to describe expected use case and requirements of NAN,
   based on OpenSG requirements.

   (TBD)


2.  SG Network Requirement

   (TBD)


3.  Use Cases and Requirements for MPL

   (TBD)

3.1.  Network Scale

   (TBD)

   10,000 nodes in 10 hops.

3.2.  Commanding Use Case

   (TBD)

   o  Transmission of 100 bytes avg to 98% of nodes within 5 seconds

3.3.  Per-Hop Requirement for Commanding

   (TBD)

   500ms/hop

3.4.  File Transfer Use Case

   (TBD)

   o  Transmission of 2MB to 98% of nodes within 7 days

   o  Transmission of 50kB to 98% of nodes within 3 days

Internet-Draft           NAN Requirement for MPL           November 2013


3.5.  Per-Hop Requrement for File Transfer

   (TBD)

   Case 1: - 2MB/7 days = 3.5 bytes per second - 1500 octet payload =>
   approx 1 data packet in 7 minutes - approx 1400 packets in 7 days

   Case 2: - 50KB/3 days = 0.19 bytes per second - 1500 octet payload =>
   approx 1 data packet in 2 hour 20 min. - approx 100 packets in 3 days


4.  Other Issues

   o  Initial state (small start) and growth of the network

   o  Exceptional deployments (high density, uneven distribution, etc)


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not make any request to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   No new security threat is identified by this requirement.

              Requirement Levels", BCP 14, RFC 2119, March 1997.
